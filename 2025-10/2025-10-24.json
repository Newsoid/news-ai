According to a survey by KPMG, 70 percent of American workers are enthusiastic about AI's benefits and 61 percent have already had positive effects for incorporating it into their work. According, 61 percent of U.S. adults have used AI in the last six months, while 19 percent interact with AI daily. However, only 39 percent of Americans use AI at least sometimes for work, education or personal tasks. For most Americans, trust remains limited, with 60 percent distrusting AI to make fair and unbiased decisions."
