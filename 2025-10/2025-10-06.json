A press release about the speech used an artificial intelligence image of the Beaux-Arts building, but journalists in the newsroom noticed some key elements missing and fabricated in the image. They are asking readers to point out the differences between the AI image and a photo taken by former Oaklandside photojournalist Amir Aziz. The person who can name the most discrepancies will win an Oaklandside water bottle."
