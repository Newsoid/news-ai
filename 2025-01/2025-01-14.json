            "summary": "The executive order directs federal agencies to accelerate large-scale AI infrastructure development at government sites. It also directs certain agencies to make federal sites available for AI data centers. The Department of Energy estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028. Developers selected to build on government sites will be required to pay all costs of building and operating AI infrastructure."

            "summary": "Biden signed an executive order to accelerate large-scale AI infrastructure development at government sites, while imposing requirements and safeguards on the developers building on those locations. The Department of Energy last month estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028. Some liberal groups say the order doesn't contain sufficient environmental protections."
