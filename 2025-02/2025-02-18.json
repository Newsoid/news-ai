The board rejected a $97.4 billion offer from Musk on Friday. OpenAI operates as a kind of nonprofit-corporate hybrid, with both the capped-profit arm and the original nonprofit side of the company controlled by a nonprofit board. It is in the middle of trying to overhaul this corporate structure to grant the for-profit side more power to raise funds. Musk is a cofounder and early investor in OpenAI."
