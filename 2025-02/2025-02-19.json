It performed tasks like searching YouTube, finding cocktail recipes, compiling shopping lists, and downloading and playing the puzzle game 2048. It also sent WhatsApp messages one by one instead of in a cohesive block. Dr. Ava Singleton believes AI agents will become as commonplace as smartphones are today."
