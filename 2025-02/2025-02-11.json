Today, sophisticated numerical weather prediction (NWP) models powered by supercomputers can process vast amounts of data in minutes, delivering highly accurate short- and medium-range forecasts. AI has further enhanced these capabilities by integrating machine learning techniques to identify subtle trends and refine predictions, while dramatically reducing the time it takes to process the data. The rise of AI has also introduced new challenges, such as the need for meteorologists to specialize in risk communication. University programs emphasize skills in data science, machine learning, and advanced analytics alongside traditional meteorological coursework."
