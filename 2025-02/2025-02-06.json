With quarantine in effect, they shifted their business model online, creating RichWine, an online service which delivers wine to consumers across the state. They also partnered with local chefs to provide food for wine tasting events in the city, which inspired them to open Penny's Wine Shop in February 2023. On Sunday, an advertisement featuring Penny's will air during the local broadcast of the Super Bowl. The commercial is part of a '50 States, 50 Stories' campaign, which will highlight the impact that Google Gemini has had on 50 small businesses."

This means AI scientists will need to leverage the already maximized models better to do end-to-end tasks. In late 2024, a team of researchers created an AI model based on LLMs that can come up with ideas on its own, review literature, gather data, generate data, write the code to run them and write a study for a peer-reviewed journal."
