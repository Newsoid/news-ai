In the early 1900s, a Spanish engineer created a chess-playing automaton called El Ajedrecista. In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published their paper 'A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity' which proposed that the brain could be considered a computational network. Alan Turing's work laid the groundwork for modern computer science. John McCarthy was the principal organizer of the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence."
