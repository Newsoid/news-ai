It's a form of what's called hybrid collective intelligence where experts use AI to process vast amounts of data, identify patterns and make predictions. In disaster response, AI systems analyze satellite imagery and sensor data, generating risk assessments that help human responders prioritize rescue efforts and allocate resources efficiently. In health care, AI helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses by analyzing large patient datasets. In the public sector, AI-powered policy simulations help governments anticipate the impacts of regulations."
