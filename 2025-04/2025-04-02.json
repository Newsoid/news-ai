            "summary": "ChatGPT's new image generator is a big leap forward from the previous version. It's still not perfect, but it's finally usable. Leslie Meredith used it to mock up a magazine cover. Designers and marketers will find it useful for quick mockups or creative brainstorming. Small business owners can create social media graphics, presentation visuals or promotional images without expensive software or graphic design skills. Educators might use it to enhance learning materials or create engaging visuals for students. Free-tier users don't have access to the image generator at all. Paid users can generate around three images a session."
