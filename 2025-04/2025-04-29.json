            "summary": "OpenAI recently launched its O3 AI model as a successor to the already impressive GPT-4. O3 can perform at or above human levels across a wide swath of tasks. For many people, in many fields, human-level AI is already here. The skills that once defined intellectual achievement, careful research, critical analysis and structured writing are no longer uniquely human. Today's AI, even O3, has no real emotions or self-awareness. Teachers are becoming more important as guides, mentors and ethical stewards of AI."
