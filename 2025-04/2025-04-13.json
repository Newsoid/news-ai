As the technology accelerates, we risk missing the deeper, more urgent issue: the legalities of a giant automated dispatching machine controlled through clever programming optimizations like surge pricing. It's important to control it and to ensure it doesn't break free from human oversight."

The National Institutes of Health, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services have moved to cut thousands of jobs and billions in federal grants that fund university research and laboratory needs. The federal government may be eyeing artificial intelligence to bridge the gap created by these cuts. Last year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists for discoveries that used AI to predict the shape of proteins and to invent new ones."
