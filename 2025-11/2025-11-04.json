It's like catfishing on steroids, because it tricks people into believing they're talking directly to someone they're interested in dating, when in reality they're flirting with and getting to know ChatGPT instead of making a genuine connection with another person. According to Taryn Sinclaire, a trans woman and trauma-focused therapist, and Dylan Thomas Cotter, an author, trans activist, former adult entertainer, Scruff dating app ambassador, and author, LGBTQ+ daters are more likely to experience it."
