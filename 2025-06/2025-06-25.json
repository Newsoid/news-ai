Professor Benjamin Becker from the Department of Psychology at The University of Hong Kong explains that the human brains are naturally wired for social interaction through evolutionary and experience shaped behaviours and brain systems that help individuals understand others, build trust, and form social bonds. People tend to treat AI chatbot and avatars like social beings (agents), attributing them with personality, feelings, and intentions. As AI becomes more advanced and personalised, these interactions will engage neural mechanisms more deeply and may even change how the brains function in social contexts. This presents exciting opportunities"
