Most productive hours of the day are between 9 and 11 a.m. and between 1 and 3 p.m., when most people's brains are at their best. The number of meetings after 8 p. m. is up 16% year over year. Most people are still checking their emails as they crawl back into bed at 10 p.M. According to Jamie Teevan, Microsoft's chief scientist and technical fellow, and Alexia Cambon, one of the lead researchers on Microsoft's Work Trends Index, AI is delivering real productivity gains, but it's not enough."
