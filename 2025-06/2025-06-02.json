Some cities use AI to simplify documents and draft memos, while other cities have implemented chatbots. Businesses are using AI to streamline customer service, forecast demand, and manage complex service delivery. In one example, an employee of a municipality used AI to draft sensitive case reports, resulting in factual errors and a ban on AI use in their department. Pasadena's greatest strength is its people, its residents, public servants, and community leaders. They must remain at the center of every decision."
