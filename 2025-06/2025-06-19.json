The increasing energy demand of AI models is driven by several factors. Complexity, training and running large language models (LLMs) and other refined AI systems require immense computational power. Data centers consume vast amounts of electricity for servers, cooling, and infrastructure. Specialized hardware, such as TPUs, are necessary to process complex AI algorithms. This energy consumption translates directly into greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Mining of rare earth minerals for hardware production compounds the problem."
