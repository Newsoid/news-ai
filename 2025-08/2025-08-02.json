This meant sensitive personal information, business strategies, and other confidential data shared during ChatGPT sessions were potentially accessible to anyone performing a targeted Google search. The issue stemmed from OpenAI's robots.txt file, which initially didn't prevent Google from crawling and indexing URLs containing chat content. This led to a widespread exposure of user data, raising important data privacy concerns. OpenAI took several steps to address the issue."
