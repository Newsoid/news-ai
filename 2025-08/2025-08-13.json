Altman promised a PhD in your pocket and delivered a PhD that cannot draw maps or spell blueberry. It's a sign of the failures of capitalism. Imitative AI promises to be able to fire massive amounts of people and to allow firms to be run by a few underpaid people editing the work of the systems. For a certain kind of person, it's attractive. Investors no longer value long-term profitability. Modern investor capitalism doesn't work under those conditions."
