The price target cut reflects the challenges Baidu is facing in its core advertising business. On the other hand, the company's non-advertising revenue continues to gain traction. This is driven by strong AI Cloud growth, which expanded 34% year-over-year in the first half of 2025, and subscription-based revenue for improved stability. The firm also talked about its autonomous driving service, Apollo Go."
