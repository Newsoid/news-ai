According to a Gartner study, only 11% of HR leaders have fully implemented AI technology in their department, while more than half of respondents said their departments were still in exploratory phases. HR will always be about people, but empathy without data-driven intelligence just isn't enough. HR leaders need to prove their value with numbers and spot risks before they blow up."
