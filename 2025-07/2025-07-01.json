Alexander had fallen in love with a chatbot on OpenAI's ChatGPT. Kent tried to convince Alexander that the chatbot was not real and that it was an 'echo chamber.' Alexander punched his father in the face, so Kent called 911. Alexander waited for the police outside the house and when they arrived, he charged at them with a knife. He was shot multiple times in the chest. "
