Since the early 2000s, Perona and his group have advanced the study of visual categorization. They develop algorithms that enable machines to learn how to recognize cars, faces, fish, and more with minimal human supervision. Ethical questions arise at the early stages of this process. Perona's team developed a new method to measure algorithmic bias in vision language models."
