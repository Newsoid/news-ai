RealSense sells cameras that use stereoscopic imaging, a process that combines two images of the same object from different angles to create depth. This technology helps machines like robots, drones and autonomous vehicles have a better perception of the physical world around them. The tech is also used for facial authentication. Chipotle has used RealSense cameras to track when food containers are low."
