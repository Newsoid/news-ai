They are fed massive datasets of text and code, learning to predict the most likely sequence of words. They lack genuine comprehension and can easily be led astray by ambiguous prompts or gaps in their training data. More data doesn't necessarily equal better performance, it amplifies biases and inconsistencies. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models retrieve relevant information from a trusted database of facts and documents, and use that information to generate a response."
