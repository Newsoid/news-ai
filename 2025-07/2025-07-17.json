It was developed by the University of Bristol in partnership with HPE and NVIDIA. It's already powering the development of models for a number of different purposes, including early diagnosis and personalised care using NHS data, inclusive language support for public services, sustainable industrial material discovery, and real-time guidance for dementia patients via wearable camera footage. The government invested £225 million in Isambard AI and its sister project, Dawn at Cambridge. "
