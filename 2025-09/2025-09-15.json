Today, AI accelerates the same problems: abundant content, ephemeral authorship, viral misinformation, and institutional erosion. It also presents the same opportunities: faster knowledge sharing, democratized access, and cognitive capabilities if governed well. The most successful actors in the printing revolution weren't those who invented the press, but those who built systems around it."
