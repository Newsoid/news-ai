Today, there are multitudes of A.i. agents that schedule meetings, manage crypto portfolios and act as virtual assistants. As the autonomy of these assistants increases, so too does the surface area for risk and misalignment. Traditional authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, API keys or OAuth tokens were never designed for persistent, autonomous agents. The goal is to be able to trace accountability without violating privacy."
