In 1974, the U.S. and British governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. By the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise, but the enthusiasm waned in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. In 2017, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology.
