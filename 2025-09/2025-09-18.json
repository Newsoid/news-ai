The deal is a lifeline for Intel and highlights a reversal of fortune between two Silicon Valley companies. Intel has struggled to keep up with technology shifts to mobile devices and AI. Nvidia, by contrast, has become geopolitically significant, producing the key chips needed for developing AI. The companies will collaborate on developing chips for personal computers and data centers."
