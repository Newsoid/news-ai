One such measure is a haphazard effort to regulate the new and rapidly evolving technology of artificial intelligence. The version introduced late last week wasn't done right and if adopted as is, would pose dire policy implications. Last year's AI legislation was an overreach and almost guaranteed to hamstrung AI development when it went into effect on February 1st."
