The first machine to pass the Turing test was Eugene Goostman, a chatbot portraying a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, in June 2014. Two AI systems, OpenAI's ChatGPT 4.5 and Meta's Llama 3.1 405B, passed the test this year. Microsoft has unveiled its new hand-sized quantum chip, Majorana 1, which may surpass that of every computer on Earth. China has been developing AI systems with little care for the consequences of rogue AI."

Women hold roughly 30% of all jobs in the tech sector in the United States, compared to just under 50% in all other areas of the workforce. The camp is five days long and costs $125, but scholarships are available to help cover the financial cost."
