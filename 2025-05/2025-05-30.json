The drug abiraterone works by blocking testosterone production throughout the body, including in the tumour. It's been shown to slash the risk of death by nearly half for about one in four men with the cancer. It can be costly and have side effects, making health authorities wary of prescribing it too readily. In the UK, abirterone has been approved in Scotland and Wales to treat newly-diagnosed, high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread. In England, it's only available through the National Health Service for men"
