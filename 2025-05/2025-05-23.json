This article breaks down the core concepts,explores future trends, and addresses the crucial ethical considerations surrounding artificial intelligence. AI is a broad concept of computer systems simulating human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where computers learn from data without explicit programming. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate human-like text, translate languages, and answer questions. General Intelligence (AGI) is the next frontier in AI research."
