The law is set to take effect in February of 2026 and would require businesses to disclose when the technology is being used for consequential decisions, like employment, bank loans, housing, and education. The governor, attorney general, Denver's mayor, and members of Colorado's congressional delegation signed a letter asking the legislature to delay the law's implementation until January 2027. The new law not only applies to tech companies but almost every company in Colorado that has more than 50 employees."
